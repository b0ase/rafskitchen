## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup Needed

### Supabase Database Setup
The whitelabel version needs a new Supabase project:

1. Create new Supabase project named "rafskitchen"
2. Set up environment variables in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   ```
3. Migrate database schema from original project
4. Configure authentication providers

## ðŸš¨ Potential Issues to Review

### 1. Homepage Services Array
The `app/page.tsx` file contains a hardcoded services array that may override the services in `lib/data.ts`. This should be reviewed to ensure consistency.

### 2. Remaining Brand References
Some references may still exist in:
- Component files that weren't updated
- API routes
- Database content (if any)
- Email templates
- Error messages

### 3. Logo and Images
The following assets need to be replaced:
- `logo-dark.png` 
- `b0ase.png`
- Any other brand-specific images in `/public` or `/images`

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test Development Server**: Verify the app runs correctly
2. **Replace Logos**: Add RafsKitchen branding assets
3. **Review Homepage**: Check if services array conflicts with data.ts
4. **Search & Replace**: Final sweep for any remaining "b0ase" references
5. **Database Setup**: Create new Supabase project and migrate schema
6. **Deployment**: Set up hosting on Vercel with rafskitchen.website domain
