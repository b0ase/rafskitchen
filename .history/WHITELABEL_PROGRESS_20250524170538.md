- [x] Updated `app/metadata.ts` with RafsKitchen tech incubator branding
- [x] Updated `app/layout.tsx` metadata for tech incubator
- [x] Updated `lib/data.ts` with tech incubator content:
  - Company name: "RafsKitchen" 
  - Tagline: "A dynamic tech incubator, transforming concepts into digital realities."
  - Bio updated for tech incubator focus
  - Social links updated to rafskitchen handles

  - Skills updated to tech stack
  - Services updated to incubator services (startup incubation, Web3 dev, AI integration, etc.)

### 2. Configuration Updates
- [x] Updated `next.config.js` to include rafskitchen.website domain
- [x] Updated `components/WelcomeActionsCard.tsx` branding and links
- [x] Updated `middleware.ts` to remove `/b0aseblueprint` route

### 3. Cleanup & Environment
- [x] Removed brand-specific directories:
  - `app/boasetoken/`
  - `app/b0aseblueprint/`
- [x] Removed unused imports in data.ts
- [x] Dependencies installed successfully
- [x] **Created `.env.local` with placeholder Supabase values** âœ¨
  - Suppresses Supabase connection errors during development
  - Allows testing the site without setting up new database
- [x] **Development server running successfully** âœ¨

## ðŸ”§ Environment Setup Status

### Temporary Development Setup âœ…
- [x] Created placeholder `.env.local` file
- [x] Development server running without Supabase errors
- [x] Site accessible for testing at http://localhost:3000

### Future Supabase Database Setup
When ready to set up the production database:

1. Create new Supabase project named "rafskitchen"
2. Replace placeholder values in `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
   ```
3. Migrate database schema from original project
4. Configure authentication providers

## ðŸš¨ Potential Issues to Review

### 1. Homepage Services Array
The `app/page.tsx` file contains a hardcoded services array that may override the services in `lib/data.ts`. This should be reviewed to ensure consistency.

### 2. Remaining Brand References
Some references may still exist in:
- Component files that weren't updated
- API routes
- Database content (if any)
- Email templates
- Error messages

### 3. Logo and Images
The following assets need to be replaced:
- `logo-dark.png` 
- `b0ase.png`
- Any other brand-specific images in `/public` or `/images`

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Test Development Server**: Verify the app runs correctly
2. **Replace Logos**: Add RafsKitchen branding assets
3. **Review Homepage**: Check if services array conflicts with data.ts
4. **Search & Replace**: Final sweep for any remaining "b0ase" references
5. **Database Setup**: Create new Supabase project and migrate schema
6. **Deployment**: Set up hosting on Vercel with rafskitchen.website domain

- [ ] Set up environment variables
